# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis was two fold; to help determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Pewlett-Hackard is on track to experience a large influx of retirees in the upcoming years and the company would like to be proactive in it's approach. 

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary: 

In order to better prepare for the "silver tsunami" Pewlett-Hackard would be wise to establish and implement their mentorship program as soon as possible. There are a total of 1918 eemployees identifies as candidates for the Mentorship program. It would be in their best interest to also identify potential candidates that would be qualified to be mentored and as well as those who could be considered for a promotion. 
In addition, an ideal approach considering the amount of employees who are likely to retire in the following years would be to have a phased program and pontenially mentor in group settings.
